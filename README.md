## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emir (or Meervix lol)! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Indonesian computer science student who are interested in Software Engineering, especially Backend Development. It's engaging for me to use logics and mathematics in order to solve various problems. I also like things that are related to Infrastructure and Cybersecurity. That's why I also do CTFs.
